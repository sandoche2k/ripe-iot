# Role of identifiers, addressing and service disocovery in IoT


## Introduction 


## Basic Terminologies 

**Naming convention :** is a set of rules defined for constituting an
identifier. For e.g., domain names should be constituted following the naming
convention as explained in [RFC1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035) 

**Identity :** is something which is definable and recognisable. It need not be
unique in a specific scope. A classic identity example is a person's name. A
name does not need to follow a specific *naming convention*. There are example
of names not only with alphabets (e.g. John Paul-II) 

**Identifier :** could be a physical (e.g. passport number) or virtual (e.g.
ToDo) identifier. It is used to identify an entity individually. It need to be
*unique* within a scope and should follow a specific *naming convention*. The
identifier will be the unique handle for the entity and will not change.

**Address :** is an identifier for the entity with an objective to communicate
with the entity such as MACID, IP addresses etc. It need to be *unique* within a
specific scope and should follow a specific *naming convention*. will be the unique handle for the entity and will 
not change.


**Service discovery :**
